NAME
    Amazon::MWS - Perl interface to Amazon Marketplace Web Services

VERSION
    0.113

DESCRIPTION
    See Amazon::MWS::Client

MWS in practice
  Product price
    Every product uploaded needs a price of 0.01 or higher, otherwise you
    get the following error:

        0.00 price (standard or sales) will not be accepted.
        Please ensure that every SKU in your feed has a price at least equal to or greater than 0.01

  Shipping costs
    You need to configure the shipping costs in Amazon Seller Central, you
    can't pass them through MWS:

    https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/shipping/dispatch.html

  Stuck uploads
    There is no guarantee that Amazon finishes your uploads at all. We had
    uploads stuck for at least a week.

  Multiple marketplaces
    You can use this module and the uploader for multiple Amazon
    marketplaces. Please make sure that you disable Amazon's synchronisation
    between marketplaces.

    For marketplaces with a different currency you need to convert your
    price first.

    The list of marketplaces can be found at:

  Throttling and Quota
    With Amazon MWS you have to deal with Amazon throttling your uploads and
    imposing quotas.

    Possible reasons:

    Upload too often
    Stuck uploads
    Orders with orderlines
